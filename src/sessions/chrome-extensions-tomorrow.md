Chrome's extensions platform is undergoing a sea change. Nearly 6 years after the current manifest version was introduced, we are revving it again. Manifest V3 rethinks several of the basics about how extensions work in order to make extensions more secure, performant, and privacy preserving.

Developers must update their extensions to ensure compatibility, and the scale of these changes depend on the extension; some extensions only need to bump the "manifest_version" in their manifest.json, while others may need significant rewrites. This talk breaks down the biggest changes in Manifest V3, the motivations for the changes, and provides guidance on how to adapt to this new world.
