Welcome to Chrome Dev Summit, where you'll hear about many new and shiny features coming soon to a Chromium-based browser near you!

But, how do those features come to be? Who decides which features should be worked on? What's the decision process that leads to shipping them? And how do web standards and other browser engines fit into all of this?

In this talk, we'll discuss all these questions and more, explaining Blink's “intent process” and how it's used to make sure the project's goal is maintained: making sure the web platform keeps growing and improving for generations to come!
